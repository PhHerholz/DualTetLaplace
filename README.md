# DualTetLaplace
A reference implementation of the dual Laplacian for tetrahedral meshes as described in ["Properties of Laplace Operators for Tetrahedral Meshes"](https://igl.ethz.ch/projects/LB3D/LB3D.pdf). 

## Use
The code depends on [Eigen] (https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen) and [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl/) for loading and saving tetrahedral meshes.
